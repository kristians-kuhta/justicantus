# Justicantus
Digital music service empowering Artists with Ethical Music Streaming on the Blockchain.

# What problems does this platform solve?
Currently, artists may have to struggle with opaque or delayed payments and unfair fees.
Wouldn't it be neat if artists could get paid for the exact amount of played minutes of their songs?
It would be great if these payments could be completely transparent and fair.

No hidden fees, delayed or incorrect payments.
All of the project's blockchain code is uploaded online and is public.
